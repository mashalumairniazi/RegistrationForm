# Project 4: Registration Form - Responsive Web Design (FCC)

##### This repository contains the completed code for Project 4 in the FreeCodeCamp "Responsive Web Design" course. 

This project demonstrates how to create a registration form using HTML and style it using CSS.

## Project Overview

The **Registration Form** project helps learners build a form that collects user input, including personal details like name, email, password, age, and more. The project also demonstrates how to style forms with CSS to create an accessible and user-friendly design.

### Key Features

- **Form Elements**: The form includes text inputs, password fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, and a file upload option.
- **Input Validation**: The form uses basic HTML5 validation, such as `required` attributes and input patterns for the password.
- **Fieldsets and Labels**: The form is organized into sections using `<fieldset>` and `<label>` elements for better accessibility.
- **Submit Button**: A large submit button is styled to be the focal point of the form.

## Code Details

### HTML Structure:

- **Form Inputs**:
  - Text fields for first name, last name, email, and password.
  - Radio buttons to select account type (personal or business).
  - File input for uploading a profile picture.
  - Dropdown menu to select how the user heard about the service.
  - A checkbox for agreeing to the terms and conditions.
  
- **Form Organization**:
  - The form is split into sections using `<fieldset>`, grouping related inputs together (e.g., account type or personal information).

### CSS Styling:

- **Background and Text**: The background is styled with a dark color (`#1b1b32`), and the text color is light (`#f5f6f7`), providing a high contrast for readability.
- **Form Layout**: The form is centered on the page and responsive, with a flexible width (between 300px and 500px).
- **Input and Button Styling**: Inputs and textareas are styled with consistent padding and colors. The submit button is highlighted with a bold background color (`#3b3b4f`) and is centrally aligned.
